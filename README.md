# Archive of HPDS 3.0

HPDS 3.0 was a cross-development environment for the HP48SX series of
calculators that I developed around 1993.

Unfortunately, I seem to have lost the source code for that project. However,
what I still have is the source code for some of the games that I developed with
it. I share this in case anybody could find any use for it. It was available for
a long time on my personal web site, but hard to find or copy. It might be of
interest for people with interest in old HP calculators.
